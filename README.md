Cookie Empire is a incremental clicker JavaScript game

## Installation
Simply clone the repository to a desired destination, and open index.html in a browser.

A running instance of the game can be found at www.cookieempire.tk. Note that this instance will be updated, and should be consider a demonstration version at the moment, rather than a full, completed game.

## To Do
* Prettify the interface with some CSS.
* Hide/display various aspects of the game, and reveal them under certain conditions (such as X number of cookies made).
* Fix the negative value for the cookies variable; this should never go below 0.
* Add a "News" section along with Sales and Production. This will display the output of a function which will display "news reports" that affect gameplay, such as "You've been fined X for bad factory hygiene" or "Employees worked overtime and made Y extra cookies" and so on.
